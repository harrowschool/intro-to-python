Homework Task - Beat The Zombie

This is the most complex task yet.  It requires several variables and two instances of selection.

- Create a list of possible weapons.
In a variable called ‘zombieWeakness’ store the name of one of the weapons from the list.
- Output messages telling the user that they have encountered a zombie and should prepare to fight.
- Output the list of weapons to the user.  Ask if they want to type 1 to use one from the list or 2 to pick their own.  If they type 1 then they should input the weapon name - store it to a new variable. If they type 2 they should input the weapon name - add it to the list and save it to a new variable.
- If the weapon picked matches the zombieWeakness, output a message telling the user that they have won the fight.  Otherwise output a message saying that they have lost.
