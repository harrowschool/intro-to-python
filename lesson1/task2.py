#Task 2a - Add comments to the code below to explain what it does

name = "Axl"

print(name)

#Extra question - why isn't 'name' in speech marks on line 5?

#Task 2b - Concatenation

#You can combine variables with strings in an output

name1 = "Axl"
name2 = "Slash"
#Add 2 more variables to store 'Duff' and 'Izzy'


#This line uses concatenation to join the variables together with the string 'and' to make a sentence.

#Complete the line to output all of the variables 
print(name1 + " and " + name2 + " and ")
