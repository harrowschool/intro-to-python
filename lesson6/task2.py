# Task 2b

 # Adapt the code from one of the functions above to create a new function called 'multiplier'.
 # The user should be able to input two numbers that are stored in variables.
 # The function should multiply the two variables together and return the result to a variable in the main program.
 # The main program should output the variable containing the result returned from the function.
