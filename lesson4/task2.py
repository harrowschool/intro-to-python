# Task 2a

  # Add comments to explain what the counter variable is used for, and what +=1 does.
  # Add a comment that explains what the condition checks for.
  # Add a line of code inside the loop that outputs the counter variable every time the loop runs.  What do you notice about what happens to it each time the loop repeats?
  # Add a line of code after the loop that outputs the message 'The loop has finished'

counter = 1

while counter < 5:
  print("This code is inside the loop")
  counter += 1


# Task 2b

  # Add a line of code to the loop that subtracts one from the counter every time the loop runs  
  # Add a line of code after the loop that outputs 'Blast off'
  # EXTRA CHALLENGE - Adapt the code so that the user inputs the start value of the counter variable.

counter = 10

while counter > 0:
  print(counter)

# Task 2c

  # Write a program that uses a loop to output the seven times table up to 12 x 7 (HINT - use the counter variable and combine it with what you learned about maths with variables.)
  # Output the multiplied number as part of a sentence.  Example - '1 times 7 is 7'

  # EXTRA CHALLENGE - ask the user to input a number and output the multiplication table for the input.
