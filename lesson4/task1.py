 # Add a line of code to the loop that outputs an 'incorrect' message to the user, tells them what to do again and lets them re-input their number
 # Add a line of code AFTER the loop that ouputs a thank you message and repeats the number entered back to the user.  Example - 'Thank you, you typed 7'

# Task 1c
 
 # Write a program that stores a secret number in a variable (you decide the number and the name of the variable)
 # The user has to guess the secret number, the program should loop until they get it right.
 # Once the user has guessed correctly they get a congratulations message
