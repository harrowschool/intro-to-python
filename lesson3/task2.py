# Add comments to the code to explain:
 # What will be output when the code is run?
 # In what circumstances would the other output message be produced

if num1 == 42:

else:

# Add to the code below so that it outputs 'You're not Dave!' if the user does not input 'Dave'

 #EXTRA CHALLENGE - Adapt the code so that it works in the same way but uses a not equal to Boolean operator.
